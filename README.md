# Pic It! 

Smart Event Photo Picker

SheInnovates Hackathon 2019 - devpost: https://devpost.com/software/pickit-ave0u8

Some 200-300 event photos could be generated for a typical university event. Out of all of the photos, there are fuzzy ones, underexposed ones and the ones where everybody seems unhappy for some reason - it takes a huge amount of time and efforts to handpick the useable photos from the pool for social media use.

Pic It! is an Android app that helps event organizers efficiently filter and rank the best, most relevant photos from all photos.

Pic It! Ranks photos using our algorithm that takes into account: 
* the quality of the photo;
* the average positive emotions on every detectable face in the frame that was analyzed using machine learning tools;
* if people have their eyes open in the picture
* (for this hackathon) gender recognition

Photos can also be filtered and re-ranked by the algorithm by selecting and placing preference to relevant tags/themes.
